## About

Hi! I'm Tim Neutkens, a 22 year old software engineer from The Netherlands.

You might know me as one of the authors of [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js) a popular open-source web development framework built on top of [React](https://github.com/facebook/react).

Another interesting project I've co-authored is [MDX](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx).
